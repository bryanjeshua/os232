## [What the Tech Industry Has Learned from Linus Torvalds: Jim Zemlin at TEDxConcordiaUPortland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XTHdcmjenI&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)
Presented by Jim Zemlin, Linus Torvalds' boss, this talk mainly focuses on several lessons that he learned from watching Linus Torvalds build Linux. The main points are: don't aim for success, give away the things we build, and have no plan. These points go against the mainstream but provide us with another perspective on how to approach any project we want to undertake to achieve something.
