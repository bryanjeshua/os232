### [What the Tech Industry Has Learned from Linus Torvalds: Jim Zemlin at TEDxConcordiaUPortland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XTHdcmjenI&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)
Presented by Jim Zemlin, Linus Torvalds' boss, this talk mainly focuses on several lessons that he learned from watching Linus Torvalds build Linux. The main points are: don't aim for success, give away the things we build, and have no plan. These points go against the mainstream but provide us with another perspective on how to approach any project we want to undertake to achieve something.
### [Free software, free society: Richard Stallman at TEDxGeneva 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)
Richard Stallman, who founded GNU, with Linux as one of its components, is sharing his views on free software. He has strong points on how computer software access and development should be democratized and not controlled exclusively by several parties. Advocating the liberation of the cyberscape is the main premise that he holds.
### [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8&ab_channel=CrashCourse)
As a medium-duration type of video, Crash Course successfully covers the topics of operating systems. It discusses the history and developments of operating systems as one of the main components of current computers, which can be found in many devices.
### [Regular Expressions - Enough to be Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBWp9EIlMM&ab_channel=EngineerMan)
Regular Expressions are great tools to process many kinds of text files. Through using Debian, I try to understand and utilize this feature, and this video helps a lot in understanding that.
